## About:

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/kfWUdYJ.png" width = 960 height = 540>


This is a 2D Platformer made in Python and based on Pygame library, the game's engine can handle a few tasks: 

* Displaying sprites and updating them.
* Displaying different animations (idle, moving, jumping...).
* Playing sounds and music.
* Displaying interactive Buttons that can be linked to different actions.
* Displaying a User Interface (Sprint bar, Money and other stuff).
* Displaying interactive cameras and updating them (the camera will change it's direction every few seconds).
* Displaying particles & different effects (running & jumping).
* Handling level transitions and level restarts.
* Editing levels using a custom integrated level editor (levels can be saved and played instantly).
* Supporting multiple game resolutions.
* And a few more minor features...

This project is no longer in-development.
